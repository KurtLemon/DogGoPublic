# DogGoPublic
The public repository for the DogGo Android app. The most updated version of this app is kept in a private repository that includes all the sensitive files and info, like API keys, signing certificates, etc. The purpose of this repository is to provide users of the app a peek into the code that drives it as well as helping out any other new Android programmers (like myself) learn some of the topics here by example.

Thank you for checking out DogGo! DogGo can be found on the Play Store at https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.kurtlemon.doggo. You can also find us on Instagram @dog.go.app for dog photos and general news about the app.

If you have any questions about the development of DogGo, business inqueries regarding DogGo, or other comments or concerns feel free to email me at klamon955@gmail.com

The majority of this code is unique and was written by me. There are certain libraries and features where small amounts of code were copied from official documentation as necessary and credit goes out to those resources as such.

Special thanks to Gina Sprint for advising me and giving me tips and countless amounts of help and advice throughout the project and for the photos of her beautiful pup Odin which appear in various places around the app, Play Store Listing, and our official Instagram. 
Special thanks to Andrew Yang for helping me write the original version of DogGo which would eventually grow and shapeshift into the project that it has become today.
Special thanks to Adam Smith for running my social media campaign and helping to build excitement for DogGo.
Special thanks to my parents for letting me run around with their phones to test the app.
And special thanks to all the friends and family who helped me along the way, listened to me complain about bugs, and kept me generally hyped for the duration of development.
