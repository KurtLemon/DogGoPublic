# DogGoPublic
The public repository for the DogGo Android app. The purpose of this repository is to highlight my skills as a programmer and to provide context for any DogGo users who might be interseted in how DogGo was created. Sensitive files, gradle files, and other generated files are not included but much of the functional code is.
